# Pinecone Query Agent

A Streamlit application that allows you to ask questions and get comprehensive answers based on information stored in your Pinecone vector database. The application uses multiple AI models to generate answers, including OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, and Deepseek.

## Features

- Query your Pinecone vector database using natural language
- Get comprehensive answers generated by multiple AI models
- View the sources of information used to generate the answers
- Choose between different AI models for different perspectives

## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Fill in your API keys in the `.env` file:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (get from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key (get from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/))
   - `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: Your Deepseek API key (get from Deepseek)
   - `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key (get from [Pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io/))
   - `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`: The name of your Pinecone index

## Running the Application

Run the application with:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:8501 (or another port if 8501 is already in use).

## Usage

1. Choose an AI model (GPT-4, Claude, or Deepseek)
2. Enter your question in the text input
3. Click "Get Answer"
4. View the generated answer and optionally expand the "View Sources" section to see the information used to generate the answer
